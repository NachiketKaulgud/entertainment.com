                <p class="btn btn-info heading"><B>Recently, while looking to purchase speakers, I headed to a Best Buy, where I tested some Bluetooth models using my phone.
                    Then I had a hilarious idea: I would stand at a distance and play fart noises on my phone through the speaker. 
                    No one would know I was the one causing the racket. I walked 15 metres away and found a track on Spotify.
                    It was called “Fart Sounds—Over 1,000 Farts,” so I knew it must be good stuff.
                    When I pressed play, nothing happened, so I moved closer, assuming I was out of range. 
                    Turns out there was a 20-second delay before the first noise. I was standing directly in front of the speaker when it produced a thundering sound. 
                    Everyone looked at me. Blushing, I darted out of Best Buy, and drove home, with no speakers and very little dignity. —D.J. Demers</B>

                <p class="btn btn-danger heading1"><B>Years ago, I worked at a bar in Montreal, bussing tables and washing dishes. Once a year, the place would throw a lavish party, with all-you-can-eat oysters. The best oyster shuckers in the city would come to compete to see who could open the most the fastest. 
                    The winner got free drinks for the night and bragging rights for a year. My job was far less glamorous: I had to haul dripping bags of shells to the dumpster. During one of my trips, I had a bright idea.
                    I returned to the kitchen, proudly (and falsely) proclaiming, “Guess what! I found a pearl!”

Production in the kitchen ground to a halt. As everyone clamoured to see my discovery, I was overcome with regret. 
I was forced to dash their hopes with a feeble “just kidding,” and quickly became a staff pariah. During my next trip to the garbage, 
I seriously considered joining the empty shells in the dumpster. —Jackie Pirico</B>
